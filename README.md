# AI-Text-Detection
AI Text Detection
This project provides an algorithm for detecting if a given text is likely to have been written by an AI. The algorithm takes into account several characteristics of AI-generated text, such as the number of unique words, the number of nouns, the language of the text, and the wording of the text. It then returns the percentage of likelihood of the text being written by an AI, based on the number of characteristics that match those of AI-generated text.

How to use
To use the algorithm, simply import the function is :

```
from ai_text_detection import is_ai_text
text = "This is an example text written by AI"
result = is_ai_text(text)
print(result)


```

This will output the percentage of likelihood of the text being written by an AI.

Requirements
Python 3
NLTK
TextBlob
langdetect

Note :

It's worth noting that even with this advanced algorithm, it's still not possible to be 100% certain whether a text was generated by AI or not. Also, this algorithm is not perfect and it's just a rough idea of the text being generated by AI.
